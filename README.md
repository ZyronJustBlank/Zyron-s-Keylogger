# Zyron's Keylogger
A completely harmless keylogger for your own personal use!
This is created using VBScript and Python :] _(python scripts are provided in library.zip)_

>> You can freely use this file personally and publicly **ONLY for educational practices**. You can also modify it in your own preferences.
>> The EXE file that contains the keylogger is called 'winupdate.exe' _(dont mind the funny name~ :3)_

**If you use this for any illegal actions, I am NOT held responsible!**
>> This keylogger is completely safe for use and totaly **NOT** malicious! >w<

**Note!-**
I have included a guide as a TXT file that should be clear to you about running the keylogger!
