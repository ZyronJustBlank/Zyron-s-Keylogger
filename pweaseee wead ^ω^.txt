hiii! //^/W/^//

In the 'Keylogger' folder contains the keylogger files!

Open the folder and there are some files (duh).

The file you will open that executes the keylogger is 'winupdate'. (i named it in a way to avoid being detected as a sus task)

When running, you might encounter a antivirus block preventing you from running the executable. So you click on 'More info' and the button will appear 'Run'!

A terminal window will launch! To stop the keylogger from running, First open Task Manager, then you will see the task 'winupdate'. R_Click and 'End Task'! The task wont automatically renew and run again. The executable can be ran if you ended the task to keep logging!

Ending the task will stop the keylogger from running and then you will notice in the same 'Keylogger' folder a txt (text file) named 'keyloggeroutput.txt'

In that text file contains every letter you typed! If you notice a symbol that appears with a question mark ()
that means a backspace was logged or a mouse action was done.

PLEASE NOTE I DONT HAVE ACCESS/REMOTE TO THESE LOGS! ALL THAT IS LOGGED IN THE TEXT FILE IS PRIVATE AND ONLY SEEN/VISIBLE TO YOU. IF YOU USE THIS FOR MALICIOUS ACTIONS, I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE OF YOU GETTING IN TROUBLE! THIS IS ONLY USED FOR EDUCATIONAL INTENTIONS AND IM NOT PROMOTING ANY ILLEGAL ACTIVITES. (ITS YOUR PROBLEM IF YOU ARE IN TROUBLE)

THIS IS COMPLETELY SAFE AND NOT MALICIOUS! ^Ï‰^
